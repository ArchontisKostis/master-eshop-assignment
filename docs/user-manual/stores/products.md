The new stock value:

## Deleting a Product

If you no longer sell a product:

1. On **My Products**, find the product in the list.
2. Click the **Delete** icon in the Actions column.
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

After deletion:

- The product is removed from your inventory list.
- Customers no longer see the product in the marketplace or product listings.

> **Note:** Deleting a product does not remove past orders that already contained that product; those remain in order history for reporting and reference.
