## Store Orders Guide

This page explains how store owners can view and understand orders placed for their store.

## Opening the Orders Page

1. Sign in as a **store owner**.
2. In the sidebar, click **Orders**.
3. You will see a list or table of orders that customers have placed for **your** store.

Each order typically shows:

- **Order ID**
- **Customer / store info** (as configured)
- **Date**
- **Total amount**
- **Status** (for example, Pending or Completed)

## How Orders Are Created

When customers check out:

- They can purchase items from multiple stores in a single checkout process.
- Behind the scenes the system creates a **separate order per store**.
- You see only the orders for **your** store:
  - Each order contains only the items that were bought from your inventory.

This multi‑vendor design lets customers shop across many stores, while each store owner sees a clean, store‑specific order list.

## Reviewing Orders

Use the **Orders** page to:

- Track incoming orders, including:
  - Which products were ordered.
  - Quantities and totals.
- Monitor order volumes over time.
- Identify best‑selling products and adjust stock accordingly via:
  - The **My Products** page.
  - The **Update Stock** action for individual products.

Order data is read‑only from the store owner’s perspective; changes to stock and products are done via the **Products** section.
