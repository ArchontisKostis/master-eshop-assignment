## Store Owner Overview

This guide explains how to use E‑Shop as a **store owner**. As a store owner you can:

- Manage a single store in the marketplace.
- Create, edit, and delete products.
- Update stock levels.
- See orders that customers have placed for your store.

Store owners do **not** manage the entire platform—only their own store and products.

## What You Need

- A modern web browser.
- The E‑Shop URL (default: `http://localhost:3000`).
- A **store owner account**, or access to a **demo store** account in development setups.
