## Customer Overview

This guide explains how to use E‑Shop as a **customer**. As a customer you can:

- Browse and search products from multiple stores.
- Compare prices and brands.
- Manage a shopping cart.
- Checkout and place orders.
- View your order history.

Every customer account is separate from store‑owner accounts. You do **not** manage products or stores as a customer.

## What You Need
