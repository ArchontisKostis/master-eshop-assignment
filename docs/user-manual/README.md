## E‑Shop User Documentation

This folder contains end‑user documentation for the E‑Shop application, split by **role** (customers vs store owners) and **topic**.

- **Application URL (default local setup)**:
  - **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`
  - **Backend API**: `http://localhost:8080`
  - **Swagger (API docs)**: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`

Your organization may expose the application under a different URL; the screens and flows remain the same.
