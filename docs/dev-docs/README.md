## Developer Documentation

This folder contains **developer‑oriented** documentation for the E‑Shop project.  
It complements the end‑user docs in `docs/` by focusing on **architecture, stack, code structure, and local development workflows**.

Top‑level tech stack:

- **Backend**: Spring Boot (Java 17), PostgreSQL, JWT authentication.
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite, Material UI, Axios, generated API client (Orval).
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose for full‑stack and dev DB setups.

## Structure

- `backend/` – backend developer documentation (Spring Boot service).
- `frontend/` – frontend developer documentation (React + Vite app).

Each subfolder has its own README with:

- How to run and debug locally (with and without Docker).
- Project layout and key modules.
- Conventions and patterns used in this codebase.
