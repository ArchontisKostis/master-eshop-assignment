## Frontend Overview

The E‑Shop frontend is a **React + TypeScript + Vite** single‑page application.

Its main responsibilities are:

- Render the user interfaces for **customers** and **store owners**.
- Implement UX flows for:
  - Landing, login, registration.
  - Customer dashboards, marketplace, filters, cart, checkout, and orders.
  - Store dashboards, product management, and store orders.
- Communicate with the Spring Boot backend via a **typed API client** (generated by Orval).
- Handle all user‑facing loading and error states.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: React
- **Dev Server / Bundler**: Vite
- **UI Library**: Material UI (MUI)
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **API Client**: Generated from backend OpenAPI spec via **Orval** (`orval.config.cjs`)

Entry points:

- `frontend/src/main.tsx` - bootstraps the React tree, theme provider, `AuthContext`, `ToastContext`, and router.
- `frontend/src/router/index.tsx` - central route configuration for public and authenticated areas.

## High‑Level Responsibilities

- **UI Shell**
  - Public layout with header/footer for landing and auth pages.
  - Authenticated dashboard layout with sidebar, top app bar, and main content area.

- **State & Context**
  - `AuthContext` for login/logout/registration and current user.
  - `ToastContext` for global notifications.
  - `useCart` hook for cross‑page cart state and counts.

- **API Integration**
  - Use Orval‑generated controllers instead of hand‑written Axios calls.
  - Normalize and handle backend errors in a consistent way.

## When to Touch the Frontend

You will typically work in the frontend when:

- Adding or modifying pages and flows.
- Wiring new backend endpoints to UI screens.
- Adjusting auth behavior or navigation.
- Changing look and feel (MUI theme, layouts, components).
- Handling new error codes or API fields returned by the backend.

- `architecture.md` - how the app is organized.
- `api-client.md` - how to call the backend correctly.
- `development.md` - how to run, debug, and build the frontend.
